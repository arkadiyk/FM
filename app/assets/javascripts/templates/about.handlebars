    <h2>Fotomoo is a tool to manage photos stored on your Google Drive</h2>

    <p class="text-error">
        At the moment Fotomoo works fully only with Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
        Unfortunately, it doesnâ€™t seem to work very well in IE

        You need to
        <strong>allow pop-ups</strong> from this site

        <small>If you see the "Loading" indicator keep spinning for what seems an
            eternity, then most likely your browser is blocking the Google Authorization popup.
        </small>
    </p>

    <div class="span6">

        <h3>First Step</h3>

        <p>
            To test whether Fotomoo fits your needs, you can upload a few (or hundreds!) of
            photos to your Google Drive. After upload is complete, please navigate to the
            {{#linkTo 'setup'}}Organize!{{/linkTo}} page
            and click on "Organize pictures!" button to process your photos.
        </p>

        <p>
            During this operation Fotomoo will create <span class= "badge badge-info">Fotomoo Pictures</span>
            folder, and <span class= "badge badge-info">By Date</span> and
            <span class= "badge badge-info">By Location</span> folder hierarchies.
            Then Fotomoo will link each photo file on your Google Drive to those hierarchies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of hierarchies created by Fotomoo are shown on the pictures on the right panel.
        </p>
        <p>
            After the <strong>Organize</strong> process is complete you can use Google Drive UI to
            take advantage of hierarchies and indexes which Fotomoo has created for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            When Fotomoo links a photo file to the Fotomoo hierarchies it does not unlink the photo file
            from its original folder.
            If you would like to keep photos only in Fotomoo hierarchies you need to use
            "Keep them managed" button on the {{#linkTo 'manage'}}Manage{{/linkTo}} page.
            If you'd like to delete Fotomoo created hierarchies leaving photo files in their
            original location please use "Unmanage All" button on the {{#linkTo 'manage'}}Manage{{/linkTo}} page.
            Because of this
            <a class="link-with-popover" href="#" data-content="Google Drive has a feature to allow a file to
          belong to multiple folders. Unlike any other filesystems with the similar feature, deleting a file from
          one of the Google Drive folders deletes the file
          from all of the folders the file belongs to.<br />
          So please be extra careful when you delete files which belong to
          multiple folders using Google Drive UI."
               >caveat</a>
            please do not use Google Drive UI delete functions to delete files which belong
            to multiple folders.

        <h3>Coming soon</h3>

        <p>
            Fotomoo is under heavy development right now. In the coming weeks you will be able to
            organize and manage your photo library in a much greater way. Here is what's coming up:
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="label label-warning" style="font-size: larger">Shared Library</span> You will be able to
            organize and manage a single Fotomoo library from multiple accounts.
            Great for family photo collections!
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="label label-warning" style="font-size: larger">Mobile App</span>
            to search and browse your photo library in the cloud. It will let you instantly find a
            picture you are looking for and show it on your mobile device. The picture will be scaled to an
            optimal resolution to minimize the loading time and network traffic.
        </p>

        <p>
    <span class="label label-warning" style="font-size: larger">
      Manage Page
    </span>
            In the coming weeks you will be able to {{#linkTo 'manage'}}Manage{{/linkTo}} your photo library
            on the cloud using Fotomoo.
        <ul>
        <li>
            Create <span class= "label">Albums</span>, assign <span class= "label">Keywords</span>,
            <span class= "label">Rate</span> and <span class= "label">Flag</span> your photos,
            write a <span class= "label">Description</span>
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class= "label">Browse</span>,
            <span class= "label">Search</span> and
            <span class= "label">Filter</span>
            your photo library using automatically and manually created hierarchies and
            attributes as well as EXIF metadata.
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class= "label">Share</span> individual photos or albums on your favorite social networks
        </li>

        <li>
            <span class= "label">Edit</span> your photos using Google Drive
            3rd party applications like <a href="http://www.picmonkey.com/">Picmonkey</a>
            or <a href="http://pics.io/">Pics.io</a>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p><p>
        For now you can take advantage of the automatically-created hierarchies and indexes using
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive web UI</a>
    </p>

        <h3>The future</h3>

        <p>
            In the future, Fotomoo will offer advanced image processing to help you organize your library and enhance your photos.
            Fotomoo will be able to recommend <span class= "label label-info">keywords</span> for you photos, detect
            possibly <span class= "label label-info">under- and over- exposed</span> photos,
            <span class= "label label-info">blurry</span> images, images with <span class= "label label-info">no content</span>,
            potential <span class= "label label-info">duplicates</span>, etc.
