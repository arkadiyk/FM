  <h3>Fotomoo is a tool to manage your photos stored on the cloud</h3>

  <p class="text-error">
    At the moment Fotomoo works fully only with Chrome and Firefox.
    There’s a good chance it will work with Safari.
    Unfortunately, it doesn’t seem to work very well in IE
  </p>

  <div class="span6">
    <p class="muted">
      <small>Currently Fotomoo works with Google Drive cloud storage only</small>
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Fotomoo</strong> organises photos on your Google Drive by <strong>automatically</strong>
      creating multiple <span class="label">folder hierarchies</span> and assigning
      <span class="label">searchable indexes</span> to your photos.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fotomoo is designed to make management of your digital assets on the cloud as effortless as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      This proof of concept is only the first step,
      and provides the bare minimum to help you organize your pictures.
    </p>

    <p class="text-error">
      In order to login into your Google account you need to
      <strong>allow pop-ups</strong> from  this site.
      <br/>
      If you see the "Loading" indicator keep spinning for what seems an
      eternity, then most likely your browser is blocking the Google Authorization popup.
    </p>

    <p>
      To test, you can copy a few (or hundreds!) of photos to your Google Drive synced folder.
      After the sync is complete, please navigate to the Organize! page
      and click on "Organize pictures!" button to organize your library.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can optionally unselect pictures which you do not want to be organized by Fotomoo.

      picture you are looking for and show it on your mobile device. The picture will be scaled to an
      optimal resolution to minimize the loading time and network bandwidth.

    </span>
      In the coming weeks you will be able to {{#linkTo 'manage'}}Manage{{/linkTo}} your photo library
      on the cloud using Fotomoo.
    <ul>

        <span class="label">Search</span>,
        <span class="label">Filter</span>,
        <span class="label">Select</span> and
        <span class="label">Share</span>
        Fotomoo managed pictures using all automatically and manually created attributes
      </li>
      In fact this is what Fotomoo is created for =)</li>
      <li><span class="label">Edit</span> your photos by integrating with Google Drive
        3rd party tools like Picmonkey or Pics.io
      </li>
      <li><span class="label">Fine tune</span> the structure and searchable indexes which Fotomoo has automatically
        created for you.
      </li>
      <li>Create your <span class="label">own hierarchies</span> and searchable indexes</li>
      <li><span class="label">Rate</span> and <span class="label">Flag</span> your photos, and assign a
        <span class="label">description</span></li>
    </ul>
    </p><p>
    For now you can take advantage of the automatically-created hierarchies and indexes using
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive web UI</a>
  </p>

    <h3>The future</h3>

    <p>
      Fotomoo will use advanced image processing algorithms
      to organize and help to enhance your images in much greater way.
      Please stay tuned!
    </p>
    <p>
      Fotomoo will work with multiple cloud storage services.
